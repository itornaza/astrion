# Astrion

An Astrology playground command line tool.

Initially it was built as a learning tool which begun in a flash cards style and evolved to include more advanced calculations and planet positions to be used for natal chart analysis.

## Target audience

This tool can be used for learning Astrology as well as enabling an Astrologer to perform basic computations that will be needed on their preparatory phase of a natal chart interpretation.

## Install dependencies

- The positions of the planets except Chiron are calculated usingSkyfield
- The position of Chiron is calculatied through the NASA Horizons system
- The positions of the Angles and Nodes are taken from the Swiss Ephimeris

To install all the necessary dependencies run the following commands:

```
% cd astrion
% python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

Open a terminal window within the `astrion` directory and just run:

```
% python3 astrion.py
```

This opens the main command line menu. Use the numbers associated to the features you wish to explore further.

## Charts and reports data

The default directory to store charts is `~/Documents/astrion-data`. There are two subdirectories there. `charts` to store the `.csv` files containing the charts, and `reports` that include the chart analysis text files generated by the program.
